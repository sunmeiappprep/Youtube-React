        "time": "3 years ago",
        "description": "Training for size and strength are two key components of building muscle, but they require different approaches and techniques. When it comes to training for size, the focus is on hypertrophy - increasing the size of the muscle fibers through high volume training with moderate to high reps and shorter rest periods. This type of training is typically seen in bodybuilding programs where the goal is to increase muscle mass and definition.\n\nOn the other hand, training for strength involves lifting heavier weights for lower reps to increase overall strength and power. Strength training programs prioritize lifting with high intensity and longer rest periods to allow for maximum muscle recovery. This type of training is often favored by powerlifters and athletes who need to improve their performance in their respective sports.\n\nWhile both types of training can complement each other, it's important to understand the differences and tailor your workout routine based on your individual fitness goals. Training for size can help build muscle mass and improve aesthetics, while training for strength can enhance overall strength and power. By incorporating a balanced approach to your training routine, you can achieve a well-rounded physique that encompasses both size and strength.",
