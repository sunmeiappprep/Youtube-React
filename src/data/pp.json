Incorrect Timing: If you are not timing your shots properly, it could result in the ball not clearing the net. Make sure you are contacting the ball at the right moment to create the necessary lift and spin to clear the net.\n\n2. Improper Technique: Your grip, stance, swing, and follow-through all play a crucial role in executing a successful forehand topspin shot. If any of these aspects are off, the ball may not make it over the net. Focus on refining your technique to achieve better results.\n\n3. Lack of Spin: To hit a successful topspin shot, you need to generate enough spin on the ball to bring it down into the court after clearing the net. If you are not imparting enough spin on your forehand topspins, the ball may fall short and land in the net. Practice developing more spin to improve your shots.",
